Programming Assignment 2<br>
CS 45500<br>
Computer Graphics<br>
Fall, 2025
</h1>

<p>
This assignment makes use of the files contained in this <a href="hw2.zip">zip file</a>.
This assignment is due Wednesday, October 8.
</p>

<p>
This assignment and your previous assignment are about the data structures used at the two ends of the 3D graphics rendering pipeline; what goes into the beginning of the pipeline and what comes out of the end of the pipeline. Roughly, what goes into the pipeline is the <a href="http://cs.pnw.edu/~rlkraft/cs45500/for-class/renderer_readmes/#scene-data-structure">Scene</a> data structure which describes the geometry of what the renderer should draw. What comes out of the pipeline is the <a href="http://cs.pnw.edu/~rlkraft/cs45500/for-class/renderer_readmes/#framebuffer-data-structure">FrameBuffer</a> data structure which holds the pixel image of the scene drawn by the renderer. The previous assignment was about just the <code>FrameBuffer</code> data structure. This assignment is about what goes into the rendering pipeline, the <code>Scene</code> data structure.
</p>

<p>
For this assignment, you will define three <a href="http://cs.pnw.edu/~rlkraft/cs45500/for-class/renderer_readmes/#model-vertex-color-primitive">Model</a> data structures that can be used to build scenes. Then you will use your models to build a sequence of <code>Scene</code> data structures that can be given to the renderer to create a sequence of <coode>FrameBuffer</code> data structures. You will then use the sequence of framebuffers to create a movie.
</p>

<p>
As we have said in class, a <code>Scene</code> is mainly a collection of models positioned in camera space. A <code>Model</code> is a list of vertices in 3-dimensional space (which we call "model space") and a list of line segments. Each <code>Vertex</code> contains three doubles (for the <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code> coordinates of a point in the model). Each <code>LineSegment</code> contains the (integer) index for two <code>Vertex</code> objects from the <code>Model</code>'s vertex list. The vertices and line segments combine to form a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire-frame_model">wire-frame</a> shape that we see as a geometric object in the scene. Each Model is combined with a Vector in a Position object. The vector is used by the renderer to translate every vertex in the model from "model space" to "camera space". This positions the model where we want it in front of the camera.
</p>

sections from <a href="http://cs.pnw.edu/~rlkraft/cs45500/for-class/renderer_readmes/">Renderer_1 Readme.md</a>.
</p>

<p>
Here is a sketch of what a <code>Scene</code> data structure looks like. Notice how a LineSegment object refers to two List<Integer> objects. The first list holds two indices into the Model's Vertex list, and the second list holds two indices into the Model's Color list.

                 x  y  z        r  g  b          /             \
                                          List&lt;Integer&gt;     List&lt;Integer&gt;
                                            (vertices)        (colors)
</pre>
<p>
When you instantiate a <code>LineSegment</code> object, you give the <code>LineSegment</code> constructor four integer values.
</p>
<pre>
<code>
   Primitive ls = new LineSegment(2, 3, 1, 0);
</code>
</pre>
<p>
The first two integer parameters are indices into the Model's <code>Vertex</code> list. The last two integer parameters are indices into the Model's <code>Color</code> list.
</p>

<p>
In the zip file there are three Java source files, <code>P.java</code>, <code>N.java</code>, and <code>W.java</code>. Each of these files defines a sub-class of the <code>Model</code> class (from the <code>scene</code> package). The file <code>P.java</code> is partly done for you. You need to complete it and the other two files so that each one defines a model that represents the letter of the alphabet the file is named after. You need to determine how many <code>Vertex</code>, <code>Color</code>, and <code>LineSegment</code> objects each model needs and then write the code that instantiates those objects and puts them into the model. Make each letter one unit tall (in the y-direction), one unit wide (in the x-direction), and a quarter unit deep (in the z-direction). Each letter should have its base line on the x-axis. The y-axis should touch the left side of each letter. The front face of each letter should be in the plane <code>z = 0</code>. The back face of each letter should be in the plane <code>z = -0.25</code>. Look at the supplied animation to see how each model's line segments should be colored.
</p>

<p>
Notice that the <code>P.java</code> file begins with a ascii-art drawing showing the numbering of its vertices. This can help a lot when you go to write the <code>LineSegment</code> constructors. I strongly suggest that you draw your own ascii-art picture for each of your <code>N.java</code> and <code>W.java</code> models.
</p>

<p>
If you want to see examples of <code>Model</code> classes, look at the files in the <code>renderer.models_L</code> package in <a href="http://cs.pnw.edu/~rlkraft/cs45500/for-class/renderer_1.zip">renderer_1.zip</a>. In particular, look at the files <code>Square.java<code>, </code>Circle.java</code>, <code>Cube.java</code>, and <code>Tetrahedron.java</code>, because those are the simplest models. (Models in the <code>renderer.models_L</code> package do not have any colors build into them. These models expect colors to be added to them after the <code>Model</code> object is created.)
</p>

<p>
After you have defined your letter models, complete the program <code>Hw2.java</code> that uses your letter models to create an animation that looks like the file <code>Hw2_animation.gif</code> from the zip file. Your letters do not have to be shaped exactly like my letters, but they should be colored the same way.
</p>

<p>
After you have defined your letter models, and before you actually start to work on the animation, write code in <code>Hw2.java</code> that just creates the initial frame of the animation. The three letters should initially have their front faces in the plane <code>z = -1.5</code>. The plane <code>z = -1.5</code> intersects the camera's view volume in a square that is 3 units wide and 3 units tall (the view volume, in the <code>z = -1.5</code> plane, extends from -1.5 to 1.5 along the x-axis, and from -1.5 to 1.5 along the y-axis.). This square is just wide enough to place the three letters next to each other. Place the three letters next to each other with the x-axis running through the middle of each letter. That should give you the correct initial positions for the three models. (See the first frame from the sub-folder <code>hw2\animation-frames</code>.)
</p>

<p>
The animation has 300 frames (numbered 0 to 299) and is divided into three sections of 100 frames each. In the first section,
</p>
<ol>
<li>the letter P moves backwards 2 units during 25 frames,
<li>the P moves to the right 2 units, while N and W move to the left 1 unit, during 50 frames,
<li>the P moves forwards 2 units during 25 frames.
</ol>
<p>
In the second 100 frame section,
</p>
<ol>
<li>the N moves up 1 unit during 25 frames,
<li>the N moves to the right 2 units, while W and P move to the left 1 unit, during 50 frames,
<li>the N moves down 1 unit during 25 frames.
</ol>
<p>
In the third 100 frame section,
</p>
<ol>
<li>the letters P and N move down 1 unit during 25 frames,
<li>the W moves to the right 1 unit, while the P moves to the left 1 unit, during 25 frames,
<li>the W moves to the right 1 unit, while the N moves to the left 1 unit, during 25 frames,
<li>the P and N move up 1 unit during 25 frames.
</ol>

<p>
Your code should move the models by modifying the translation <code>Vector</code> object associated with each <code>Model</code> object.
</p>

<p>
The folder <code>hw2\animation-frames</code> contains an image file for every frame of the animation so that you can check exactly where each model should be positioned in each frame.
</p>

<p>
For more information about creating an animation, read the <a href="http://cs.pnw.edu/~rlkraft/cs45500/for-class/renderer_readmes/#position-and-animation">Position and Animation</a> section from <a href="http://cs.pnw.edu/~rlkraft/cs45500/for-class/renderer_readmes/">Readme_r1.md</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you want to see examples of how to move models in an animation, look at the files <code>OfflineCube.java</code>, <code>OfflineCubes.java</code>, and <code>OfflineMovie.java</code> in the <code>clients_r1</code> package in <a href="http://cs.pnw.edu/~rlkraft/cs45500/for-class/renderer_1.zip">renderer_1.zip</a>.
</p>

<p>
You should not change the package structure of the <code>hw2</code> folder. The files <code>Hw2.java</code>, <code>P.java</code>, <code>N.java</code>, and <code>W.java</code> are in the default package of the folder <code>hw2</code>. <em>Do not</em> give those classes a package statement. All the renderer classes are in the <code>renderer_1.jar</code> <a href="http://cs.pnw.edu/~rlkraft/cs45500/for-class/renderer_readmes/#jar-files">jar file</a>.  You compile the <code>Hw2.java</code> file with the following command-line.
</p>
<pre>
<code>
   javac -cp .;renderer_1.jar  Hw2.java
</code>
</pre>
<p>
After your program compiles, you run <code>Hw2</code> with the following command-line.
</p>
<pre>
<code>
   java -cp .;renderer_1.jar  Hw2
</code>
</pre>
<p>
The included build script, <code>build_&_run_client.cmd</code> sets the classpath appropriately.
</p>

<p>
If you want the VS Code editor to work correctly with <code>Hw2.java</code> and <code>renderer_1.jar</code>, then read the <a href="http://cs.pnw.edu/~rlkraft/cs45500/for-class/renderer_readmes/#jar-files-and-vs-code">section about VS Code and jar libraries</a> from <a href="http://cs.pnw.edu/~rlkraft/cs45500/for-class/renderer_readmes/">Renderer_1 Readme.md</a>.
</p>

<p>
After you have <code>Hw2.java</code> working, convert the image frames that your program produces into a real "animation" file. To do this you need to download the following zip file and unzip it to your <code>C:\</code> directory as the folder <code>C:\ImageMagick-7.1.2-3-portable-Q8-x64.zip</code>.
</p>
<center><a href="https://imagemagick.org/archive/binaries/ImageMagick-7.1.2-3-portable-Q8-x64.zip">ImageMagick-7.1.2-3-portable-Q8-x64.zip</a></center>
<p>
After you have <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a> on your computer, and after you run your program to produce all the animation frames, just double click on the command file <code>ImageMagick-7.1.2-3-portable-Q8-x64.zip.cmd</code> and it should use your frames to create an animation file called <code>animation.gif</code>. Double click on your animation file to see your movie.
</p>

<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> The <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a> project updates it distribution fairly often. When it does, the previous distribution's link no longer works. The above link to download their zip file will probably no longer work after a week or two. If the link is broken, go to their <a href="https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php#windows">download page</a> and find the latest version.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://cs.pnw.edu/~rlkraft/cs45500/handin.html">Turn in</a> a zip file called <code>CS455Hw2Surname.zip</code> (where <code>Surname</code> is your last name) containing <em>just</em> your versions of <code>P.java</code>, <code>N.java</code>, <code>W.java</code>, <code>Hw2.java</code>, and <code>animation.gif</code>. Please <b>DO NOT</b> submit the frames for your animation or the folder <code>animation-frames</code>.
